# Fit_header_reader
For Astron 1263, to automatically create observation logs from fits header data

## How to use  
I've had trouble with running the program from VScode, but opening directly from the terminal seems to work  
use the terminal to navigate to where the program is located and type "python Fit_header_reader" and press enter
